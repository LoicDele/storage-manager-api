storage-manager-api is a REST API developed with the Lumen PHP Framework. The goal of this personal project is to learn every subtlety of REST API and BACK-END services. When the development of this API will be finished, i will start developing the FRONT-END in ANGULAR (the framework can change).

This REST API allows to manage a little store.

If you want to comment or improve my work, I will be happy to converse with you!
